## COMP2200 Group 36

This repository contains project notebooks for COMP2200 Data Science Group Project, Session 2 2021, Macquarie University.
The name of our Data Science project is **Using Cluster Analysis to Investigate Australian Suburb Similarity**

This Notebook contains analysis on Income and Rent Data obtained from the ATO Website and Demographics Data Scraped from the ABS Census website for 2016. The demographics data consists a merge of Marital Satus, Income, Rent, Religion, Gender, Age and and post code remoteness.

All the demographics data sets were downloaded and transposed and converted to CSV in Excel. All data sets used can be found in the Data files folder. 

The Analysis required a lot of experimentation before a reasonable conclusion to what works the best for this data set could be made. All the experimentation files can be found in the Experimentation Files folder. The files are named for reader's ease of use. These files contain alternatives for the final code, such as analysing results through PCA instead of variables or Clustering with the outliers etcetera. 

The Final Note book follows the following format: 

Demographic Analysis
 - Data Preparation
 - Univariate Analysis
 - Bivariate Analysis
 - PCA
 - Hierarchical Clustering 
 - NSW Postcode Post Similar to Victoria
ATO Data Analysis
- Univariate Analysis
- Bivariate Analysis
- PCA
- Clustering
    - K-mean 
    - Hierarchical 
- Predictive Analytics Demographics Data 
- Predictive Analytics ATO Data
- Conclusion

All analysis are reproducable, however, when the code is rerun, the cluster numbers seem to switch. The cluster traits and characteristics, however, remain the same.
